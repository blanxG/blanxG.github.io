I’m a PhD student at [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.fr) in the Department of Mathematics and at [Laboratoire d’Océanographie et du Climat](https://www.locean.ipsl.fr) in the Department of Earth Sciences, at Sorbonne University, where I work on the acceleration of ocean model initialization with generative ML methods. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at the European Space Agency as a Graduate Trainee on closed-loop life support system for Mars mission. I received my Master degree from ISAE-Supaero in aerospace engineering and my second Master from ENS Paris-Saclay in [Mathematics, Learning and Vision](https://www.master-mva.com) (MVA). 

In my free time, you’ll find me in the mountains hiking, running or biking with friends.
